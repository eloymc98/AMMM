# Integer Linear Programming and Heuristics

You can find the problem statement in **project.pdf** in the relative route ./project.pdf.

You can find the project report in **project_report.pdf** in the relative route (./project_report.pdf)

We have structured the project in three different directories:

* **Generator** (./Generator): contains the files that are needed to create the problem instances that is used by the solvers.
* **Heuristics** (./Heuristics) contains the files needed to solve the problem instances applying different heuristics.
* **OPL** (./OPL) contains the code to use in [IBM ILOG CPLEX](https://https://www.ibm.com/es-es/products/ilog-cplex-optimization-studio) needed for solving the problem instances.
